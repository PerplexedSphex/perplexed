# The Perplexed Sphex

> ... this is a rather shocking revelation of the mechanical underpinning, in a living creature, of what looks like quite reflective behavior.

> There seems to be something supremely unconscious about the wasp's behavior here, something totally opposite to what we feel we are all about, particularly when we talk about our own consciousness. I propose to call the quality here portrayed sphexishness, and its opposite antisphexishness (a vexish word to pronounce!), and then I propose that consciousness is simply the possession of antisphexishness to the highest possible degree. - [Douglas R. Hofstadter](http://proofmood.com/jhjeong/Texts/sphex.html)
