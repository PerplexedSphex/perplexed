> the attempt to deal with these two major questions: what are the **thinking processes** that enable people to **invent simple solutions** to seemingly complicated situations? How can we use the **psychological aspects to assist**, rather than impair, the implementation of those solutions in a mode of an ongoing process?

---

> We grossly underestimate our intuition. Intuitively we do know the real problems, we even know the solutions. What is unfortunately not emphasized enough, is the vast importance of verbalizing our own intuition. As long as we will not verbalize our intuition, as long as we do not learn to cast it clearly into words, not only will we be unable to convince others, we will not even be able to convince ourselves of what we already know to be right. **If we don't bother to verbalize our intuition, we ourselves will do the opposite of what we believe in**. We will ''just play a lot of games with numbers and words.''

---            

> The first step is to recognize that **every system was built for a purpose**. We didn't create our organizations just for the sake of their existence. Thus, every action taken by any organ—any part of the organization—should be judged by its impact on the overall purpose. This immediately implies that, **before we can deal with the improvement of any section of a system, we must first define the system's global goal;** and the measurements that will enable us to judge the impact of any subsystem and any local decision, on this global goal.

---                

> we can describe the next steps in two different ways. One, in which we are using the terminology of the system that we are trying to improve. The other, using the terminology of the improvement process itself. We in that both descriptions are very helpful and only when both are considered together, does a non-distorted picture emerge.
                
---

> A system's constraint is nothing more than what we all feel to be expressed by these words: **anything that limits a system from achieving higher performance versus its goal**.

---                

> 1.   `Identify the System's Constraints`.   Once this is accomplished—remember that to identify the constraints also means to prioritize them according to their impact on the goal, otherwise many trivialities will sneak in—the next step becomes self-evident.

---              

> 2. `Decide How to Exploit the System's Constraints`.   Now that we decided how we are going to manage the constraints, how should we manage the vast majority of the system's resources, which are not constraints? Intuitively it's obvious. We should manage them so that everything that the constraints are going to consume will be supplied by the non-constraints. Is there any point in managing the non-constraints to supply more than that?
                
---

> 3. `Subordinate Everything Else to the Above Decision.`

---                

> Whatever the constraints are, there must be a way to reduce their limiting impact and thus the next step to concentrate on is quite evident.   4.   `Elevate the System's Constraints`.

---                

> If we elevate and continue to elevate a constraint, then there must come a time when we break it. This thing that we have elevated will no longer be limiting the system.

---               

> 5.  `If in the Previous Steps a Constraint Has Been Broken, Go Back to Step 1`.

---               

> But `Do Not Allow Inertia to Cause a System Constraint`.'' We cannot overemphasize this warning. What usually happens is that within our organization, we derive from the existence of the current constraints, many rules. Sometimes formally, many times just intuitively. When a constraint is broken, it appears that we don't bother to go back and review those rules. As a result, our systems today are limited mainly by policy constraints.

---               

> As we said before, the only way not to cause severe distortions, is to describe the same process, but this time using the terminology of the improvement process itself.

---               

> Thus, if a process of ongoing improvement is to be effective, we must first of all find—`WHAT TO CHANGE`. In other words, the first ability that we must require from a manager is the ability to pinpoint the core problems,

---               

> But once a core problem has been identified, we should be careful not to fall into the trap of immediately struggling with the question of How To Cause The Change. We must first clarify to ourselves—`TO WHAT TO CHANGE TO`—otherwise the identification of core problems will only lead to panic and chaos.

---               

> Complicated solutions don't work, simple one's might. Once the solution is known, and only then, are we facing the most difficult question of—`HOW TO CAUSE THE CHANGE`.

---               

> If the first two questions of WHAT TO CHANGE? And TO WHAT TO CHANGE TO? are considered to be **technical questions**, then the last one, HOW TO CAUSE THE CHANGE? is definitely a **psychological one**.

---               

> In our organizations there is generally more than just a little bit of politics. Struggling and surviving these politics gives us a deep intuitive understanding of the psychological processes involved. What we have to do is to verbalize these processes.

---               

> What we want to implement is a Process of Ongoing Improvement, where change is not an exception but rather the norm. Where change is ongoing, we must be much more methodological in our approach to the improvement process itself,

---               

> Any improvement is a change.   Not every change is an improvement but certainly every improvement is a change.

---               

> Any change is a perceived threat to security.   There will always be someone who will look at the suggested change as a threat to their own security.

---               

> Anybody who thinks we can overcome an emotional resistance with logic was probably never married. We can only overcome emotion with a stronger emotion.

---               

> what is the emotion that we are trying to trigger by such a presentation? If it wasn't clear before, now it is certainly obvious. We are using fear and insecurity. We are trying to overcome the immediate insecurity resulting from change, by provoking the long term insecurity of what will happen if we don't change. We are fighting fire with fire. But let's not forget, whenever we use fire to fight fire somebody gets burnt. To use such an emotion in order to constantly sustain a process of ongoing improvement, a process where change is the norm, means that we have to constantly create an environment of insecurity in our organizations. Do we really want it? Is that the environment we want to work in?

---               

> We were radiating emotion to the extent, that they probably referred to our idea as OUR BABY. Where improvement is concerned, more than one emotion is present. Not just the emotion of resisting change, but the very powerful emotion of the inventor.

---               

> What is the minimum that is required for a person to gain the emotion of the inventor, the ownership of an idea?

---               

> 1. Does the emotion of the inventor arise whenever a person is figuring out an idea for themselves, even though they know that others have already figured it out? 2. Is the Socratic method still applicable in our modern times?

---               

> if the positive emotion of the inventor is not triggered, then by default, the opposite emotion—that of hate, will be.     What causes us to hate someone? If that person does something to us that we don't particularly like. Most of us don't like to be criticized. Vicious criticism, we like even less. But there is one thing that we simply cannot tolerate—constructive criticism. Constructive criticism means that there is something correct in the criticism.

---               

> The minute you supply a person with the answers, by that very action you block them, once and for all, from the opportunity of inventing those same answers for themselves. If you want to go on an ego trip, to show how smart you are, give the answers. But if what you want is action to be taken, then you must refrain from giving the answers.

---               

> 1. What to change? Pinpoint the core problems! 2. To what to change to? Construct simple, practical solutions! 3. How to cause the change?   Induce the appropriate people to invent such solutions!

---               

> Let's try to verbalize the rules that comprise the Socratic method. When we are trying to induce someone to invent a solution, for a problem which is under their control, the first step that must be accomplished is quite obvious. We must make sure that the problem we present to our audience will be regarded by them as their problem—a major problem of theirs.

---               

> that we face in using the Socratic method is thus, the need to formulate another way to prove things. A way which does not rely on examples or references but on the intrinsic logic of the situation itself, which is by far more convincing than the usual methods. This method of proof is called Effect-Cause-Effect

---               

> The three distinct stages that every science has gone through are: classification, correlation and Effect-Cause-Effect.

---               

> The widely accepted approach is to define science as the search for a minimum number of assumptions that will enable us to explain, by direct logical deduction, the maximum number of natural phenomena. These assumptions—like the gravitational law—can never be proven. Even when they can explain an infinite number of phenomena this does not make them true. It simply makes them valid. They can still be disproved. One phenomena that cannot be explained makes the assumption false, but in doing so it does not detract from its validity. It simply puts the boundaries on the circumstances where the assumption is valid and exposes the opportunity to find another assumption that is even more valid. Science does not concern itself with truths but with validity. That's the reason why everything in science is open for constant checks and challenges.

> One man was the major force behind it—Dr. Taichi Ohno. He started his career as a foreman and recently retired as the Executive Vice President of Production for all of Toyota. He is the inventor of the Toyota Production System and the Kanban approach. He is the inventor of the powerful correlations that we call Just-In-Time. Correlations like: if products are not needed downstream—as indicated by the lack of Kanban cards—it is better for the company that the workers stay idle or, cut the batch sizes of parts even if the cost of setup skyrockets.

---               

> This process of speculating a cause for a given effect and then predicting another effect stemming from the same cause is usually referred to as Effect-Cause-Effect.

---               

> Now the audience has to be induced to derive simple, practical solutions. The major obstacle to accomplishing such a task is the fact that people usually already have in their minds, the ''accepted'' solutions.

---               

> Remember, we are dealing with core problems and typically core problems. They have usually been in existence within our environment for many months or even years—they do not just pop up. This provides us with the best indication that the perceived solutions are insufficient, otherwise the core problem would have already been solved.

---               

> ''accepted'' solutions are false, otherwise they will not think, they will just quote. It's not unusual to find that the accepted solutions, which do not work, are solutions of compromise. Our observation is that whenever a core problem is confronted, it turns out that the core problem was already intuitively very well known (even though not necessarily well verbalized) and already compromising solutions were implemented in an futile attempt to solve the problem. Inducing people to invent simple solutions, requires that we steer them away from the avenues of compromise and towards the avenue of re-examining the foundations of the system, in order to find the minimum number of changes needed to create an environment in which the problem simply cannot exist. I call the method which can accomplish this the Evaporating Clouds method. Assuming that a core problem can be described as a big black cloud, then this method strives not to solve the problem (compromise) but to cause the problem not to exist.

---               

> ''God does not limit us, we are limiting ourselves'' and the second, which is regarded to be more practical, ''You cannot have your cake and eat it too.'' These two sentences seem to be in contradiction. But the mere fact that they are so widely accepted indicates that both are valid. The second sentence is just a vivid description of the existence of compromising solutions. The first one probably indicates that, whenever we face a situation which requires a compromise, there is always a simple solution that does not involve compromise. We just have to find it.

---               

> ''define a problem precisely and you are halfway to a solution.''

---               

> a problem exists whenever there is something that prevents, or limits us, from reaching a desired objective. Therefore, defining a problem precisely must start with a declaration of the desired objective. What should we do next? Let's remind ourselves that what we are dealing with are the type of problems that involve compromise. A compromise between at least two bodies. In other words, we have to pacify, or satisfy, at least two different things if we want to achieve our desired objective.

---               

> whenever we are facing a problem which involves a compromise, there are at least two requirements which must be satisfied. In other words to reach the objective there are at least two necessary conditions which must be met. Thus, the next step in precisely defining a problem is to define the requirements that must be fulfilled. But the definition of the problem cannot stop here. We should realize that whenever a compromise exists, there must be at least one thing that is shared by the requirements and it is in this sharing that the problem, between the requirements, exists.

---               

> Let's start by calling the desired objective ''A.'' In order to reach ''A'' we must satisfy two different requirements, ''B'' and ''C,'' where the prerequisite to satisfying ''B'' is ''D'' and the prerequisite to satisfying ''C'' is the opposite of ''D.'' Or the prerequisite to satisfying ''B'' is some amount ''D'' that must be given to it and the prerequisite to satisfying ''C'' is some additional amount of ''D'' that must be given to it and we don't have enough of ''D.''

---               

> 1   The Setup Cost:   If we set up a machine for one hour and then produce only one unit of a given item, then this unit will have to carry the entire cost of the one hour of setup. But, if after the one hour setup, we produce ten units of a given item, then each unit will have to carry only one-tenth of the cost of one hour of setup. Thus if we want to reduce the setup cost per unit, we should strive to produce in as large a batch as possible.

---               

> 2   The Carrying Cost:   Setup is not the only channel by which the size of the batch impacts the cost per unit. We are all aware that as we enlarge the size of the batch we will enlarge the amount of time that we will hold the batch in our possession and thus we increase the carrying cost of inventory. Most articles indicate a linear relationship; doubling the size of the batch roughly doubles the carrying cost. When considering the carrying cost per unit, we should strive to produce in the smallest batches possible.

---               

> The Evaporating Clouds method does not strive to reach a compromise solution, rather it concentrates on invalidating the problem itself. The first attack is made on the objective itself asking, ''Do we really want it?'' How can we find out? The easiest way is by comparing the objective in question to the global objective. This comparison is achieved by simply trying to restate the problem using the terminology of the global objective rather than the local terminology.

---               

> Now the solution is obvious. We should strive to maximize the process batches on the bottlenecks, while at the same time using small transfer batches everywhere— including through the bottleneck (small transfer batches do not have any impact on setup).

---               

> In order to understand the impact of work-in-process inventory on due dates we must examine something that looks at first glance as totally unrelated—the validity of our product forecast. Almost every plant has a forecast of demand which is quite reliable for some period of time into the future, then the validity of the forecast drastically deteriorates within a very short period of time. What causes this universal phenomenon? If all companies in an industry are providing delivery of a product within two months, then customers will not place orders and commit themselves to specific due dates a year in advance. They probably will place their orders about 21/2 months before they need the product. Even when they place an order for a whole year, they will feel free to change the quantity and ship date two months in advance without risk of jeopardizing deliveries or placing their vendors in an impossible situation. Consequently, the plant's forecast for this product will be quite reliable for the first two months and quite unreliable for the period beyond three months. If we operate with high inventory relative to our competitors, it means that our production lead time is longer than the valid forecast horizon of the industry. The length of the valid horizon will be dictated by our low inventory competitors. As a result, the high inventory company's production plans are based on pure guesses and not on a reliable forecast. It's no wonder that due-date performance is a problem where we have high inventories. When we operate in a lower inventory mode than our competitors, we enjoy an enviable position that gives us an inherently more accurate forecast. Now when we start production, we have firm orders or a valid forecast which is much less likely to change. Our due-date performance will certainly be much improved. Our production plans are now driven by more reliable information and we are in a much better position to give reliable requirements to our vendors. Remember, a prime reason that our vendors cannot deliver reliably is because we keep changing our requirements on them, the same way our customers are changing their requirements on us. How about the last competitive element, shorter quoted lead times? We will again find that inventory play an unexpected role?
