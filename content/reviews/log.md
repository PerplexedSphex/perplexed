 - context: **call with Luke**
 - "do more and throw the extra away" is useful thing to keep in mind
 - obv it is easy to take this the wrong way and do too much of the wrong thing
 - but when outcomes have already been decided on it makes sense in pursuit of those outcomes
 - there is a reason to draft first and then edit, rather than mixing up the two

 - context: **home**
 - got some caffeine drinks
 - the duchess (typed the vine at first) is not bad for work when I have a task - once each task was completed, however, I found it difficult to switch to the next/make a decision.
 - takeaway: distraction matters most when you don't have a next item in working memory
 - have a big monitor, makes a big difference

  - it feels good to know that you are doing the right things
  - you can feel this way if you have a system that tells you what the right things to do are
  - manic state, muscular excitement
  - give puzzles to dan
  - product management
  - consistent activity
  - food, always an issue
  - no value in rationality meetups
  - no value of rationality facebook or lesswrong either
  - these are just garbage
  - phones are a big context switch
  - one state of mind to another is a big switch
  - no value in circling either
  - read n books in 3 days and create book notes
   - inspired
   - predictable prospecting
   - the effective executive
   - nonviolent communication
    - the impulse to get everyone to agree to a communicaiton norm/procedure
    - is an impulse to police thsir behavior instead of attending to your own
    - by externalizing rules into a shared system, you shift the focus onto searching for rulebreakers
    - by maintinaing the rules as private, you can truly engage with them
    - because they don't have any signalling value
    - or any value in policing others
    - or in punishing defectors
    - so what are some rules for life?
     1. keep your rules private
     2. make assumptions explicits
     3. align your actions with your endorsements
     4. be predictable
     5. maintain consistent activity
     6. do nothing that isn't worth doing
     7. catch, review, and avoid repeating mistakes
     8. read more of your own words than those of others (the former includes excerpts of others' writing that you have selected)
     9. cultivate sense of regret and surprise
